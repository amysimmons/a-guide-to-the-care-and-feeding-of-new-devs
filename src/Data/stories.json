Involve Juniors in thinking problems, and recovering from mistakes. Don't expect them to maintain legacy systems, but instead let them write new (well scoped) projects. Encourage them to learn, don't punish mistakes but show how it's done. Create value and attachment rather than pushing them towards a burn out.",
    "What one thing would help you progress faster in your first 12 months as a developer?":"Well, the first 12 months as a dev I was in school trying to learn stuff. In general classes in school are pretty bad, so hey.\n\nIn the first 12 months as a professional dev (had my anniversary only a few weeks ago) it would've been nice to have more skilled people around me. People from whom I can learn. People that are equally excited about things, but show are willing to reason about the trade offs. People who don't punish a different opinion, but instead embrace different thinking. It'd be nice if people in tech were, well, nice.",
    "What's something technical you are embarrassed to admit you don't know?":"My regexes are rusty; I'm pretty bad at using capture groups haha. Also: I wouldn't know how to setup a DNS server... which I had to do today, but could reason my way out of not doing. Pfooooo.",
    "Can you recount the worst day of your first 12 months as a developer? What happened, and why was it so bad?":"Ohey, that one's good. Either the time the designer came over and pulled my headphones off my head, grabbed my arm and screamed at me... or the time when the project lead screamed at the whole team, lashed out towards the easiest target on the team and got him into tears.\n\nYeah, it's not fun to join dysfunctional teams when you feel that if you leave it'll be a giant stain on your career options (because people are connected with every other company in the city.) Without a name you won't survive that.",
    "Can you recount the best day of your first 12 months as a developer? What happened, and why was it so good?":"Well, there's two days:\n\n1. Probably the first talk I gave. People were amazed by some of the architecture foo you can pull off with npm's userland packages. I felt great, and decided I wanted to share more knowledge with people at meetups... more than \"hey, check out this framework I tried\".\n\n2. The first deploy I made of a native desktop app I built. It was my first \"finished\" application ever. All systems were operational including UI (transitions!), architecture and reverse-engineered API client. It felt good. I felt I could make things, I felt empowered. I knew that if I kept going this way I would eventually make it, and eventually I did.",

    "Can you recount the worst day of your first 12 months as a developer? What happened, and why was it so bad?":"The worst day no. but I have always been a person who's never seen sexism in a workplace and didn't understand all the fuss. The worst moment for me was when I realised I was a woman in tech, and I was being treated differently. But I won't get into that now. \nBut worst moment === When you know you're the woman in the room.",
    "Can you recount the best day of your first 12 months as a developer? What happened, and why was it so good?":"The best technical day was when programming clicked. I wrote a complete creative project from scratch in a day without looking for any example of how someone else did it. MY COPY AND PASTE DAYS WERE OVER! ha.\n\nBut the best day was when my manager pulled me aside, had a catch up with me and checked how I was doing, made sure I was alright, and encouraged me to not be that hard on myself. He showed me I was valued even as a junior. - to me that was the best day because it gave me what I needed to keep going, without that I would probably have never made it to the day programming clicked for me.",

    "What one thing would help you progress faster in your first 12 months as a developer?": "It would have been helpful to me if my team knew my background before I started my first project.
