# a-guide-to-the-care-and-feeding-of-new-devs

In November 2015 I surveyed junior web developers to find out how they could be better supported in the workplace. [This website](http://amysimmons.github.io/a-guide-to-the-care-and-feeding-of-new-devs/) outlines my findings.

I presented my findings at CampJS in Brisbane on November 21, 2015: vimeo.com/154932127
